## FsLexYacc


2024-08-28 Niels - THIS IS OLD AND NOT ACCORDING TO HOW dotnet WORKS TODAY
WILL UPDATE

### A what?

In this course you will write small

[lexers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) and
[parsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing#Parser) using
respectively [FsLex] and
[FsYacc](https://fsprojects.github.io/FsLexYacc/), and we have decided
to keep it as minimal as possible. Instead of a full-blown Visual
Studio project with excessively many tools and nuget packages, we have
opted for a more minimal approach: you basically download and install
the tools locally, and run them in your command line (typically
Terminal.app on macOS and CMD/Powershell on Windows). If you are
unfamiliar with running applications or scripts in your command line,
or if all of this sounds like alien talk, please read the [following
guide](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/command-line-basics-web-development-101),
and do the exercises too. The guide is mostly relevant for Mac/Linux,
but you can surely find stuff for Windows Powershell/CMD, too. The
command line is a dear friend that you will use a lot in your
professional life as well.

### Installation

#### Mac/Linux
*This guide was written on a Macbook Air with the M1
chip, but it should be the same for other Mac systems and Linux
too. Please ping us if you have issues.*

As you may know, `.exe`-files are native executables on Windows, and
therefore Mac/Linux will not understand them. For that, you need
Mono. After that you will be able to do:

`mono my_executable.exe`

**Steps**

1. Clone this repository and grab the executables/DLLs from the
`fsharp` directory, and put them in `$HOME/bin/fsharp` or
`~/bin/fsharp` (or some other place you fancy; at least moving them
out of `~/Downloads` is recommended)

2. Head to [Mono’s
website](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) and fetch
latest version (I picked Visual Studio channel)

3. After installation, you should have `mono` available in your
command line (close and reopen your Terminal if you cannot run it)

**Usage**

Follow the README's files in the respective directories, i.e. in
`Expr/`. Generally, you want to do:

*(note that `<text>` means that you need to replace `<text>` with what
 makes sense)*


For lexing:
`mono ~/bin/fsharp/fslex.exe --unicode <lexer>.fsl`

And parsing (essentially the same):
`mono ~/bin/fsharp/fsyacc.exe --module <module-name> <parser>.fsy`


**Put a script on it**

*Note: out of scope for course / for terminal aficionados only*

Now, you will do this a lot, so a small script can come in handy

`fslex <lexer>.fsl` and `fsyacc <parser>.fsy`

**fslex**
```{bash}
#!/bin/bash
BASE=$HOME/bin/fsharp
FSLEX=$BASE/fslex.exe
mono $FSLEX --unicode $*
```

**fsyacc**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
BASE=$HOME/bin/fsharp
FSYACC=$BASE/fsyacc.exe
FILE_NAME=${1%%.*}
mono $FSYACC --module $FILE_NAME $*
```

Both scripts are placed in `~/bin` folder (which is added to path;
look this up if unsure what it means), and made executable by running
`chmod +x fslex fsyacc`.

#### Windows
*This guide was written on a system running Windows 10, on an AMD CPU.*

**Setup**

- Fetch the repository and from the '/fsharp' folder, move 'fslex',
  'fslex.exe', 'fsyacc' and 'fsyacc.exe' to somewhere else, or don't,
  the important part is that you know where they are.

- Edit your environment variables, to include the location of those files.

- Click the windows button on your keyboard, and write "miljø"/"environment".
  - Select the option "Rediger systemmiljøvariabler"/"Edit the system environment variables".
  - A window will open, with a button "Miljøvariabler..."/"Environment variables..." on in it. Click that button.
  - Another window will open, showing the User and System environment variables.
  - In the User environment, locate the variable named "Path", select it, and click "Rediger..."/"Edit".
  - Yet another window! Click "Ny"/"New", and enter the path to 'fslex.exe' etc.
  - Click "Ok" until all the windows are gone.

- Now find a place for the files 'FsLexYacc.Runtime.dll' and "FSharp.Core.dll", where you can find them again. Somewhere close to where you will be doing the exercises is very nice.

**Usage**
| Action | Command |
| -- | --- |
| Generate lexer | `fslex --unicode <PATH_TO_FILE>.fsl` |
| Generate parser | `fsyacc --module <MODULE_NAME> <PATH_TO_FILE>.fsy` |
| Start interactive | `fsi -r <PATH_TO_FsLexYacc.Runtime.dll> <PATH_TO_FILE>.fs*` |
| Compile | `fsc --standalone -r <PATH_TO_FSharp.Core.dll> -r <PATH_TO_FsLexYacc.Runtime.dll> <PATH_TO_FILE>.fs*` |

*Depending on how you installed it, `fsi` might be called `fsharpi` or
 `dotnet fsi` instead.'\*' denotes that the preceding element can be
 repeated.*

## Known issues

* If you have issues with no syntax check (Intellisense) or type
  annotations from Ionide in Visual Studio Code, try changing your
  file extension from `.fs` to `.fsx` (or vice-versa) while developing

* If you get problems with `LexBuffer<byte>` expected
  `LexBuffer<char>`, make sure you have the unicode flag when running
  your lexer, i.e. `fslex --unicode <lexer>.fsl`

* If your have problems with "Lexing" namespace, try remove
  "Microsoft" from the namespace in your `.fsl` file, rerun `fslex
  --unicode <lexer>.fsl` and try again. If you are on Windows, you
  might NEED the "Microsoft." part in front of the Lexing namespace

* If you get an error like this when running your `<lexer>.exe`,
  i.e. on Mac/Linux `mono Lexer.exe`:

```
  Unhandled Exception:
System.BadImageFormatException: Could not resolve field token 0x04000026, due to: Could not load type of field ...
```

  you can try copy the FsLexYacc.Runtime.dll to your local folder. For
  some reason when running the executable it will look for the DLL in
  the current folder.

Do the following in your terminal when you are inside the folder where
your `exe` is (Linux/Mac):

```
  cp /Path/To/Your/FsLexYacc.Runtime.dll .
```

* If you get `<SOMETHING> is not recognized as an internal or external
  command`, that simply means that your command line does not
  recognize the command you just typed. In terms of `fsharpc` or
  similar, try instead `dotnet fsc`, or simply `fsc` – if none works,
  you need to find out where your F# compiler is on your machine, and
  then add it to your
  path. [Here](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/08/31/how-to-change-environment-variables-on-windows-10/)
  is a guide for Windows, and
  [here](https://osxdaily.com/2014/08/14/add-new-path-to-path-command-line/)
  for Mac/Linux

* The F# compiler (`fsc`) is not automatically added to a lot of users
  on Windows, and it's quite hard to find. One solution that has
  worked for me & others is to install F# through Visual Studio (you
  need either the Community or Enterprise version - **NOTE**: this is
  NOT Visual Studio Code), and then find the `fsc.exe` that
  appears. For me, it appears at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft
  Visual
  Studio\2019\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\FSharp`
  - if you are not sure, go to Visual Studio through your file
  explorer and search in the corner for `fsc.exe` - that should make
  it appear if it exists

* PowerPack and its DLL is depracated (dead and gone); you should only
  use `FsLexYacc.Runtime.dll`, and you should only use that very one
  that comes with your `fs(lex|yacc).exe` files
